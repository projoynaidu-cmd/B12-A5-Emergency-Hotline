## FAQ

1.  **What is the purpose of the "coin" system?**
    The coin system is a simple gamified feature to make the application more interactive. Each call costs a certain number of coins.

2.  **Is this a real application that can make calls?**
    No, this is a front-end project for demonstration purposes. Clicking the "Call" button will simulate a call by showing an alert, but it will not make a real phone call.

3.  **How can I add more hotline numbers?**
    The hotline numbers are currently hardcoded in the application. To add more, you would need to modify the source code.
